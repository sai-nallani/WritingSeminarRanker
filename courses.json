    "course_description": "Frogs in spaceships. Cheetahs in mansions. Squirrels on campus. Animal lives are entangled with ours in ways big, small, and unexpected, yet they are difficult to grasp using traditional tools of human-centric inquiry. We cannot interpret a dog\u2019s dream or interview an elephant\u2013unless we seek radical new possibilities for interspecies understanding. What do we learn by questioning, or crossing, the human-animal divide? How do concepts such as civilization or wilderness, intelligence or instinct, mastery or coexistence, shape our shared existence? This Writing Seminar invites students to experiment with ideas about human-animal relations which challenge the boundaries between species and attune our senses to the other creatures on our planet. We begin by engaging with Donna Haraway\u2019s concept of \u201cnatureculture\u201d while carrying out close observations of the often-unnoticed animal lives playing out on Princeton\u2019s campus. Next we dive into the weird world of \u201cde-extinction\u201d and consider how the quest to resurrect the passenger pigeon reflects evolving notions of ecological balance, technological supremacy, genetic purity, ethical obligation, and more. For the final research project, students will employ theoretical and practical tools to bridge or break down the species boundary as they investigate the implications of specific human-animal entanglements. Potential topics include the unfolding of Australia\u2019s Emu War, the cultural phenomenon that was Tiger King, the technological evolution of Sony\u2019s aibo robotic dog, or the centrality of mice to the human scientific apparatus."

How might we understand this mixed legacy of botany and the \u2018bad\u2019 side of botany? What makes some plants scientific wonders, valuable fortunes, or criminal objects\u2013or all three at once? We begin by going back almost 500 years to analyze how 16th-century European naturalists described the curious plants of the \u2018New World\u2019 and renamed the natural world according to their own vision. Next, we turn to Central American bananas and the United Fruit Company as students investigate how biodiversity is impacted when plants become global commodities. For the final project, students will research a plant of their choosing in the context of a specific social or climate justice movement, economic project, or colonial encounter. Possible topics include seventeenth-century tulip mania, the race to develop synthetic rubber during World War II, the grape boycott of 1960s California, shamanic ayahuasca tourism, and taxing marijuana for public education."

Yet at the same time, people routinely get tattoos and piercings, take muscle-building supplements, doctor their selfies, and donate their bodies for science. What are the politics of displaying and modifying the body\u2013whether one\u2019s own or someone else\u2019s? What happens when cultural convictions about the sanctity of the body come into conflict with scientific discovery, artistic freedom, or self-actualization? Why do some treatments of the body seem commonplace, while others seem indulgent, sacrilegious, or freakish? This Writing Seminar explores how we observe, treat, manipulate, and represent the human form. We begin in the Library\u2019s Special Collections, analyzing historical political caricatures and what their grotesque physical exaggerations can reveal about the social meaning of bodies. Next, we take rhinoplasty (aka, the \u201cnose job\u201d) as our case study to examine the real-life body\u2019s plasticity through disciplines ranging from medicine, technology, and economics to aesthetics, cultural studies, and religion. For the research paper, students choose a practice or controversy involving the human body and craft an original argument placing it in a cultural, political, or scientific context. Examples range from TSA body scanners and bans on gender-affirming healthcare, to vaccine choice, the \u201ccarnal art\u201d of ORLAN, ableism and colorism in Oscar-winning films, and Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein (or, The Modern Prometheus)."

In what ways might the commodification of craftwork challenge our understanding of authenticity? How do we relate to an object when physical interaction is replaced with a virtual showcase? In this Writing Seminar, we explore the complicated relationship between craft and profit, interrogating authenticity and appropriation. Students begin by making their own craft, investigating the relationship between raw materials, tools and technologies, and techniques. We then shift perspective from maker to consumer as students examine Etsy\u2014an online marketplace for handmade, vintage and custom goods\u2014by exploring the sociology of craft industries, the economics of peer-to-peer platforms, and the colonial legacy of craft in Western cultures. For the research project, students investigate a historical or contemporary making practice of their choice. Sample topics include foodie appropriation of non-Western recipes, Lynn Hershman Leeson\u2019s AI generated photographic portraits of people who don\u2019t exist, debates over authorship and ownership in music sampling, and the legacy of craftivism from and criticism of  the pussyhats worn during the 2017 Women\u2019s March."

How does our relationship with the tools available to us impact our ability to think critically, tinker with new possibilities, and meet today\u2019s demands? Where do we direct the focus of our attention and care? And who gets to decide? We begin this Writing Seminar by reflecting on tools for writers\u2013from pencils and keyboards, to spell check, predictive text, and voice-to-text\u2013as we examine tensions between repair and revision. We turn next to the aftermath of the US Civil War, when a chaplain from Central Park Hospital organized a penmanship contest for disabled veterans: a case study for students to analyze experiences\u2014and challenges\u2014of suddenly living in a body the world wasn\u2019t built for. In the final project, students identify an instance \u201cwhere stuff goes wrong\u201d and develop a researched argument about the dynamics of critical care.

And yet, as the largest minority group in America, disabled people remain disproportionately disenfranchised, underemployed, and poor. How do theories of disability account for the diversity of disability experiences in America today? When it comes to disability rights and justice, what is the relationship between accessibility, accommodations, and inclusion? And what can disabled experiences teach us about our collective humanity? In this Writing Seminar we begin by analyzing the contentious scholarly debate about medical and social models of disability in light of the historic Disability Rights Movement. Next, we investigate the sprawling Princeton campus, the iconic\u202fThe Americans with Disabilities Act, and the often elusive concept of disability justice\u202fin the context of scholarship on racism, neoliberalism, universal design, and assistive technology. Finally, in the research unit, students expand their study of disability and justice to imminent and global challenges like disaster preparedness and evacuation plans, accessibility issues amid refugee crises, augmented communication and artificial intelligence, COVID vaccinations, crip sexuality, cochlear implants and Deaf culture, and the rise of anxiety disorders among young people."

Today, health insurance companies often cover, and even require, patients to seek second opinions. In a dissent, Justice Elena Kagan warns that the Supreme Court has sidelined scientific experts and given itself \u201cexclusive power over every open issue\u2014no matter how expertise-driven.\u201d From entertainment to science and public policy, expertise informs modern life. Yet, delineating and vetting sources of expertise is no straightforward task. How do people decide who to trust and when? How do different forms of expertise intersect or clash? To what extent does expertise boil down to persuading others? In this Writing Seminar, we investigate how expert authority is constructed, communicated, and contested. We begin by analyzing restaurant reviews, considering how cultural critics strive to judge with objectivity. Next, we journey back in time to ancient Athens, examining the earliest recorded epidemic for insights into how the general public and established experts navigate a crisis together. Finally, students develop independent research projects on cases of disputed authority. Sample topics include online \u201cwellness influencers,\u201d the MLB\u2019s robot umpires, cases of falsified forensic evidence, Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, or the contentious artwork known only as Comedian, which features a banana taped to a wall."

Only weeks later, however, President Xi Jinping promised to send additional bears, which he described as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d In this Writing Seminar, we examine the stuff of friendship, from pandas to Facebook pages. What is friendship? How have friends, whether nations or individuals, used images and objects\u2014including living flora and fauna\u2014to define, strengthen, and showcase their bonds? What can the visual and technological culture of friendship tell us about changing conceptions of friendship itself? We begin the semester in Special Collections at the Princeton University Library, exploring how 19th-century friendship albums allowed their makers to sustain ties across time, space, and shifting identities. Next, we turn to current debates over A.I. companions, analyzing the design of the chatbot Replika in conversation with philosophical, psychological, and biological perspectives on the purpose and meaning of non-kin networks. For their final papers, students will make an original, researched argument about a representation or understanding of friendship. Examples range from early modern libri amicorum (books of friends) and elephant diplomacy to contemporary friendship bracelets, Netflix Teleparties, and the \u201cFind My Friends\u201d app."

From the labeling of Indigenous lands as terra nullius on colonial maps to contemporary narratives of urban blight, spatial metaphors that depict landscapes as vacant or degraded have long served to legitimize claims of ownership and value. But what makes space valuable or livable? Whose perspectives count in the interpretation of geographies, and what implications do those representations have for how places are inhabited and understood? This Writing Seminar explores how communities are transformed through the categorization, contestation, and reenvisioning of space. We begin with 1930s redlining maps, interrogating how ideas of neighborhood value and residential risk shaped American cities. Next, we turn to the Great Dismal Swamp on the border between Virginia and North Carolina, examining how forbidding marshlands became places of refuge and refusal during the antebellum era. For the research paper, students will investigate a site of their choice\u2014real, speculative, or symbolic\u2014that has been reclaimed or reimagined. Possible topics include the 1973 reoccupation of Wounded Knee by the American Indian Movement, the mapping of the human genome, seasteading, the Occupy Wall Street movement, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone, Black Panther\u2019s afrofuturist Wakanda, guerrilla gardening, and Dante\u2019s Inferno."

How do we make sense of symptoms? How do race and gender shape perceptions of health risk and responsibility? To what extent do genetic testing, laboratory findings, and diagnostic standards expand or limit what physicians can see? When does illness become identity?

    "course_description": "Fools crowned king, animals roasting cooks, and fish sprouting wings\u2014motifs of the world turned upside down have a long artistic and political history. Periods of upheaval continue to shape our world, from economic crashes, black swan events, and popular uprisings to generative AI and catastrophic climate change. These events reorder the status quo and restage relationships of influence and meaning, but why are some reversals liberatory and empowering, while others are repressive? In this Writing Seminar, we explore how revolutions\u2014whether political, cultural, economic, or scientific\u2014shift norms, social structures, and hierarchies, and how one\u2019s own position and perspective affect interpretation of such events and their place in history. We\u2019ll spend the first half of the seminar considering modes of inversion and the grotesque, analyzing popular media and scientific research in conjunction with Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s theory of the carnivalesque. In the second half of the seminar, students will investigate an inversion, reversal, or revolution in a case study of their choosing for a final original research paper. Examples include cross-dressing during Mardi Gras, the art of Wong Ping, The Hunger Games, the morality of the criminal underworld, or reordering caused by an economic, political, or natural crisis, such as an environmental effect of COVID-19\u2019s \u201canthropause.\u201d"
