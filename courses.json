Animal lives are entangled with ours in ways big, small, and unexpected, yet they are difficult to grasp using traditional tools of human-centric inquiry. We cannot interpret a dog\u2019s dream or interview an elephant\u2013unless we seek radical new possibilities for interspecies understanding. What do we learn by questioning, or crossing, the human-animal divide? How do concepts such as civilization or wilderness, intelligence or instinct, mastery or coexistence, shape our shared existence? This Writing Seminar invites students to experiment with ideas about human-animal relations which challenge the boundaries between species and attune our senses to the other creatures on our planet. We begin by engaging with Donna Haraway\u2019s concept of \u201cnatureculture\u201d while carrying out close observations of the often-unnoticed animal lives playing out on Princeton\u2019s campus. Next we dive into the weird world of \u201cde-extinction\u201d and consider how the quest to resurrect the passenger pigeon reflects evolving notions of ecological balance, technological supremacy, genetic purity, ethical obligation, and more. For the final research project, students will employ theoretical and practical tools to bridge or break down the species boundary as they investigate the implications of specific human-animal entanglements. Potential topics include the unfolding of Australia\u2019s Emu War, the cultural phenomenon that was Tiger King, the technological evolution of Sony\u2019s aibo robotic dog, or the centrality of mice to the human scientific apparatus."

Even before a child is born, we discuss, celebrate, and make assumptions about the person they will grow into based on their anatomy. What messages are we conveying in doing so? How does gender inform a person\u2019s sense of self? And what are the consequences for those whose gender identity does not align with that assigned at birth? This Writing Seminar analyzes how gender is taught, embodied, resisted, redefined, and policed. First, we explore concepts of visibility, transnormativity, and identity in Alok Vaid-Menon\u2019s primer, Beyond the Gender Binary. Next, we turn to sociology, medicine, and history to examine Christine Jorgensen\u2019s experiences transitioning in the 1950s and the price of public visibility thereafter. For the final project, students write an original research paper about an institution, text, practice, or artifact that defines, reconfigures, or resists gender norms. Sample topics include state laws regulating access to bathrooms, the economics behind the \"pink tax\" on consumer products like tampons, representations of gender within the TV series Schitt\u2019s Creek, or the historical memory of watershed events, such as the Compton\u2019s Cafeteria Riot or Stonewall."

How might we understand this mixed legacy of botany and the \u2018bad\u2019 side of botany? What makes some plants scientific wonders, valuable fortunes, or criminal objects\u2013or all three at once? We begin by going back almost 500 years to analyze how 16th-century European naturalists described the curious plants of the \u2018New World\u2019 and renamed the natural world according to their own vision. Next, we turn to Central American bananas and the United Fruit Company as students investigate how biodiversity is impacted when plants become global commodities. For the final project, students will research a plant of their choosing in the context of a specific social or climate justice movement, economic project, or colonial encounter. Possible topics include seventeenth-century tulip mania, the race to develop synthetic rubber during World War II, the grape boycott of 1960s California, shamanic ayahuasca tourism, and taxing marijuana for public education."

What are the politics of displaying and modifying the body\u2013whether one\u2019s own or someone else\u2019s? What happens when cultural convictions about the sanctity of the body come into conflict with scientific discovery, artistic freedom, or self-actualization? Why do some treatments of the body seem commonplace, while others seem indulgent, sacrilegious, or freakish? This Writing Seminar explores how we observe, treat, manipulate, and represent the human form. We begin in the Library\u2019s Special Collections, analyzing historical political caricatures and what their grotesque physical exaggerations can reveal about the social meaning of bodies. Next, we take rhinoplasty (aka, the \u201cnose job\u201d) as our case study to examine the real-life body\u2019s plasticity through disciplines ranging from medicine, technology, and economics to aesthetics, cultural studies, and religion. For the research paper, students choose a practice or controversy involving the human body and craft an original argument placing it in a cultural, political, or scientific context. Examples range from TSA body scanners and bans on gender-affirming healthcare, to vaccine choice, the \u201ccarnal art\u201d of ORLAN, ableism and colorism in Oscar-winning films, and Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein (or, The Modern Prometheus)."

But how does visibility translate to power? In what ways can greater representation effect real change, and to what extent does it risk recasting the status quo? And when representation becomes a marketing strategy, how does it speak to consumers and shape understandings about being seen?  In this Writing Seminar we look both at and beyond symbolic gestures to examine the meaning, impact, and limits of representation for social justice. First, we analyze the critiques of patriarchy advanced by the Barbie (2023) movie, questioning the extent to which a world dressed in pink signals liberation from gendered constraints. Next, we investigate recent controversy over Google Gemini\u2019s image generation, in which attempts to fix the AI\u2019s racial bias resulted in overcorrection that produced historically inaccurate scenes of WWII Nazi soldiers and antebellum US senators as people of color. Students conclude the seminar by developing an original research project that can contribute to scholarly conversations about representation.

In what ways might the commodification of craftwork challenge our understanding of authenticity? How do we relate to an object when physical interaction is replaced with a virtual showcase? In this Writing Seminar, we explore the complicated relationship between craft and profit, interrogating authenticity and appropriation. Students begin by making their own craft, investigating the relationship between raw materials, tools and technologies, and techniques. We then shift perspective from maker to consumer as students examine Etsy\u2014an online marketplace for handmade, vintage and custom goods\u2014by exploring the sociology of craft industries, the economics of peer-to-peer platforms, and the colonial legacy of craft in Western cultures. For the research project, students investigate a historical or contemporary making practice of their choice.

We begin this Writing Seminar by reflecting on tools for writers\u2013from pencils and keyboards, to spell check, predictive text, and voice-to-text\u2013as we examine tensions between repair and revision. We turn next to the aftermath of the US Civil War, when a chaplain from Central Park Hospital organized a penmanship contest for disabled veterans: a case study for students to analyze experiences\u2014and challenges\u2014of suddenly living in a body the world wasn\u2019t built for.

Next, we interrogate the adolescence of GenAI, examining the GAN artwork of young digital artist Robbie Barrat from diverse disciplinary perspectives such as computer science, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and ecology in order to investigate the complex relationship between imitation, learning, and creativity. Students conclude the seminar by researching an instance, design, or depiction of raising and training a mature AI to become integrated in human affairs. Possible objects of analysis include the short stories of sci-fi author Greg Egan; Grief Tech and ghostbots; Project Cybersyn in 1970s Chile; and Ruha Benjamin\u2019s concept of the New Jim Code."

From the labeling of Indigenous lands as terra nullius on colonial maps to contemporary narratives of urban blight, spatial metaphors that depict landscapes as vacant or degraded have long served to legitimize claims of ownership and value. But what makes space valuable or livable? Whose perspectives count in the interpretation of geographies, and what implications do those representations have for how places are inhabited and understood? This Writing Seminar explores how communities are transformed through the categorization, contestation, and reenvisioning of space. We begin with 1930s redlining maps, interrogating how ideas of neighborhood value and residential risk shaped American cities. Next, we turn to the Great Dismal Swamp on the border between Virginia and North Carolina, examining how forbidding marshlands became places of refuge and refusal during the antebellum era. For the research paper, students will investigate a site of their choice\u2014real, speculative, or symbolic\u2014that has been reclaimed or reimagined. Possible topics include the 1973 reoccupation of Wounded Knee by the American Indian Movement, the mapping of the human genome, seasteading, the Occupy Wall Street movement, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone, Black Panther\u2019s afrofuturist Wakanda, guerrilla gardening, and Dante\u2019s Inferno."

How has childhood as a social category been defined and redefined in different times and different cultures? In this Writing Seminar, we consider the constantly changing perceptions of those earliest years of human development. We begin with an examination of how dominant ideas in a society find expression in children\u2019s toys, from the dollhouse to the Rubik\u2019s Cube. We then explore the role of literature and socialization in the elementary school classroom, investigating how books like The Cat in the Hat and Where the Wild Things Are shape a child\u2019s ideas about race and gender.

How do we make sense of symptoms? How do race and gender shape perceptions of health risk and responsibility? To what extent do genetic testing, laboratory findings, and diagnostic standards expand or limit what physicians can see? When does illness become identity? We\u2019ll start by examining chronic disease, before moving deeper into the contested phenomenon of \u201cLong COVID,\u201d investigating how sufferers seek to make sense of their symptoms, how exchanges between patients and practitioners shape medical knowledge about the condition, why it has been so challenging to define and diagnose, and the stakes of doing so. Then, for their final projects, students will research the representation or conceptualization of a disease or illness experience of their choosing. Possible topics include \u201cOzempic shaming\u201d; the gender politics of pharmaceutical advertising; addiction risk algorithms; social media \u201cwellness\u201d fads; illness in TV medical dramas; and the art of the AIDS crisis."

In this Writing Seminar, we\u2019ll explore the various perspectives that scientists, artists, engineers, and other scholars can bring to our understanding of the human brain and the person it creates. We\u2019ll begin by exploring the 19th-century practice of phrenology, asking ourselves what happens when science and ideology meet. Next, we will carry these questions into an examination of more modern human brain mapping techniques, probing the biological, social, economic, and political impacts of new neuroimaging technologies that arose at the dawn of the 21st century.

This isn\u2019t only true of the iPhone\u2014from the amateur to the avant-garde, artistic work has always been the product of complex social and material processes. How do these processes inform or challenge our appreciation for works of art? What might the art itself hide or reveal about those processes?

Employers, workers, credit rating agencies, and investors have different opinions about the sources and measures of worth. But how do we account for non-economic measures? In this Writing Seminar we explore debates about where value comes from. First, we will  Adam Smith and crunch data from the International Labor Organization to grapple with the problem of unpaid labor. Next, we turn to cartoons and editorials, banknotes and technology patents, congressional debates and bankruptcy cases to investigate the first major speculative boom and bust in US history, the Panic of 1837. For the research paper, students investigate a case study of their choice that illuminates the contested nature of measuring value.
